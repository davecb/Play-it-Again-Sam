# mkLoadTestFiles(1) 
mkLoadTestFiles - create files to get in a test
## SYNOPSIS
Usage: mkLoadTestFiles [-from N -for N -rewind][-v] load-file.csv url

## DESCRIPTION
This program creates a set of files for a load test, by default in a 
local filesystem.  The files contain different amounts of the same
sequence of random data.

It exists to avoid having the logic in runLoadTest, although it reports
its performance in exactly the same way as runLoadTest does.

### Data options   
-for int 
* number of records to use, eg 1000.   
  This limits the number of files to be created.  

-from int 
* number of records to skip, eg 100.   
  This starts at a particular record in the file

### Misc options      
-d	
* add debugging messages  
  This is for debugging the load generator itself.
      
-v
* add verbose messages    
  This is for debugging the system under test, by seeing more about
  what it is doing. Shows the request and response in more detail.

### Config-file options 
These options are from the config-file parser, which allows any of the
above options to be specified in a configuration file.
   
-allowMissingConfig 
 * Don't terminate the app if the ini file cannot be read. 
   
-allowUnknownFlags 
 * Don't terminate the app if ini file contains unknown flags.  
 
-config string 
 * Path to ini config for using in go flags. May be relative to the 
 current executable path.   
 
-configUpdateInterval duration 
* Update interval for re-reading config file set via -config flag. 
  Zero disables config file re-reading. 
   
-dumpflags 
* Dumps values for all flags defined in the app into stdout in 
  ini-compatible syntax and terminates the app.    


## FILES
The input and output files are identical, of the form
```csv
#yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss latency xfertime sleeptime bytes url rc op
2017-09-21 08:15:07.270 0 0 0 0 /zaphod-beeblebrox.jpg 200 GET

```
As an input, only the url and the file size are significant. The url is 
concatenated to the prefix provide on the command-line and used as the 
filename to be created.

## EXAMPLES


## BUGS

## DIAGNOSTICS
If an error occurs, the program reports as much as possible and stops.

During normal operation, a small number of status messages will also
be written to stderr to indicate the progress of the test.
