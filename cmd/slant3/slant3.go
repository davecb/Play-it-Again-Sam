//I'll help you create a solution to find the lowest points and draw lines between them using Go and Gonum plot. Here's how we can do this:
//Here's how to draw a line from the overall lowest point to the next lowest point on its right using Go and Gonum plot:

package main

import (
	"gonum.org/v1/plot"
	"gonum.org/v1/plot/plotter"
	"gonum.org/v1/plot/vg"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	// Sample cloud of points
	points := plotter.XYs{
		{X: 1, Y: 2},
		{X: 2, Y: 1},
		{X: 3, Y: 4},
		{X: 4, Y: 0.5},
		{X: 5, Y: 3},
		{X: 6, Y: 2},
		{X: 7, Y: 1},
	}

	// Sort points by X coordinate
	sort.Slice(points, func(i, j int) bool {
		return points[i].X < points[j].X
	})

	// Find lowest points and create lines
	var lowestPoints plotter.XYs
	currentLowest := points[0]
	lowestPoints = append(lowestPoints, currentLowest)

	for i := 1; i < len(points); i++ {
		if points[i].Y <= currentLowest.Y {
			currentLowest = points[i]
			lowestPoints = append(lowestPoints, currentLowest)
		}
	}

	// Create plot
	p := plot.New()
	p.Title.Text = "Points with Lowest Connection Line"
	p.X.Label.Text = "X"
	p.Y.Label.Text = "Y"

	// Add scatter plot for all points
	scatter, err := plotter.NewScatter(points)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	scatter.Radius = 3
	p.Add(scatter)

	// Add line connecting lowest points
	line, err := plotter.NewLine(lowestPoints)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	p.Add(line)

	// Save plot
	if err := p.Save(6*vg.Inch, 4*vg.Inch, "lowest_points.png"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

//plot_lowest_points.go
//This code:
//
//Creates a cloud of points
//Sorts them by X coordinate
//Finds the lowest points by scanning left to right and keeping track of the lowest Y value seen
//Creates a plot with both the original points and a line connecting the lowest points
//Saves the plot as a PNG file
//To run this code, first install the required package:
//
//go get gonum.org/v1/plot
//
//The algorithm works by:
//
//Starting with the leftmost point as the current lowest
//Moving right through the sorted points
//When a point with a lower or equal Y value is found, it's added to the lowest points collection
//These lowest points are then connected with straight lines
//The output will be a PNG file showing:
//
//All points as dots
//A line connecting the sequence of lowest points from left to right
//This creates a "lower envelope" of the point cloud, which could be useful for various applications like terrain analysis or finding minimum paths.
